Welcome to our **AI with Model-Based Design** workshop! This hands-on experience is designed to empower you with the knowledge and skills to develop AI models using MATLAB and Simulink. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user, this workshop will introduce you to essential tools and methodologies for AI development within Model-Based Design.

Throughout this workshop, you will engage in three comprehensive chapters, each featuring hands-on exercises to solidify your understanding:

1. **Design and Train a Neural Network**: Learn how to create a feedforward neural network and integrate it into a Simulink simulation.
2. **Integrate TensorFlow Models**: Discover how to import a model from TensorFlow and seamlessly integrate it into Simulink.
3. **Model Compression and Code Generation**: Compress an LSTM model using projection, generate C/C++ code from Simulink with Embedded Coder, and profile its performance.


## Setup Instructions

1. **MATLAB Online**: This workshop is designed to be delivered on MATLAB Online, ensuring you have the necessary tools without the need for local installations.
2. **On-Site Participants**: If attending an on-site session, please bring your laptop and ensure you have the Google Chrome browser installed.
