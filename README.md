## Agenda

In this hands-on workshop, you will learn how to develop AI applications using MATLAB and Simulink. Our goal is to introduce you to tools and approaches for developing AI models with Model-Based Design.
The workshop comprises three main chapters with hands-on exercises for each topic:
1.    Design and train a feedforward neural network and integrate it into a Simulink simulation
2.    Import a model from TensorFlow and integrate it into Simulink
3.    Compress the LSTM model with projection, generate C/C++ code from Simulink with Embedded Coder, and profile performance

The example data set we will use contains data for estimating the state of charge (SOC) of a battery based on temperature, voltage, and current. The workshop is designed to be delivered on MATLAB Online.

MathWorks instructors and teaching assistants (TAs) will be available throughout the session to guide you. If the event is being held on-site, please bring your laptop and install the Google Chrome browser beforehand.
